# Annotation MCP Usage Example

This directory contains multiple examples of how to use the Axiomatic Annotations MCP server.

The main intend of this MCP is to give grounding material to your assistant by providing citations and references. Annotations contain statements, parameters, equations, and other relevant information about the source you provide. Even though LLMs and Agents can already process the source on their own, they are not guaranteed to do so correctly and structuredly. Annotations provide a common ground for both the assistant and the user to base their work on.

## Examples

Eight examples are provided in this directory, each containing an example query (in query.md) which is to be copy pasted into the MCP enabled assistant (e.g. Cursor or Claude Code), the paper to annotate (in _.pdf), and the annotations (in _.md). Please note that depending on how the assistant queries the MCP tools, results may differ from the ones provided here.

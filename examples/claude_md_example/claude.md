# Claude Code Configuration

## MCP Servers

This project is configured with the following MCP servers for enhanced functionality:

### Research & Academic

- **zotero**: Reference management with AI-powered semantic search
- **semantic-scholar**: Academic paper search and citation analysis
- **arxiv**: arXiv preprint server access
- **google-scholar**: Google Scholar academic search

### Mathematics & Computing

- **mathematica**: Symbolic mathematics and computation
- **mathematica-docs**: Mathematica documentation access

### AI Tools

- **axiomatic-plots**: AI-powered plot data extraction from images
- **axiomatic-documents**: Document analysis and processing
- **axiomatic-pic**: Photonic integrated circuit design
- **axiomatic-equations**: Mathematical equation composer and solver
- **axiomatic-model-fitting**: Digital twin optimization tools
- **axiomatic-annotations**: Document annotation and analysis tools

### Development

- **jupyter-datalayer**: Jupyter notebook manipulation and execution (Datalayer MCP Server)

## API Keys

- OpenAI API Key: Configured for zotero embedding functionality and statement negation
- Wolfram Script: Configured for mathematica servers

## Commands

To check MCP server status: `/mcp`
To get help with Claude Code: `/help`

## Usage rules

- For any prompt related to fitting or optimization, use the axiomatic-model-fitting MCP
- For any prompt related to parsing a paper, use the axiomatic-documents MCP

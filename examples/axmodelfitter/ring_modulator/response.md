# Ring Modulator Model Fitting Results

## Summary

Successfully fitted the ring modulator transmission model to experimental data using AxModelFitter MCP. The model achieves an excellent fit with **R² = 0.964**, explaining 96.4% of the variance in the experimental data.

## Mathematical Model

The ring modulator transmission is modeled as:

```math
T(\lambda, V) = \left \lvert \frac{t-a e^{2\pi j n(V) L/\lambda}}{1-t a e^{2\pi j n(V) L/\lambda}} \right\rvert^2
```

Where:
- `t = √(1-κ)` - transmission coefficient determined by coupling coefficient κ
- `a = 10^(-αL/20)` - decay factor accounting for ring losses with parameter α
- `n(V) = n₀ + gₙV` - voltage-dependent effective refractive index
- `L` - ring length
- `λ` - wavelength
- `V` - bias voltage

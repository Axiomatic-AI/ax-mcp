# AxModelFitter Demos

The following demos showcase common use and workflow integrations of Axiomatic's AxModelFitter MCP for estimating parameters of algebraic and differential equation models and ancillary statistical analyses. All demos consist of a lightweight prompt (`prompt.md`) describing the model, data and task. The responses as generated by Anthropic's Claude Code with access to AxModelFitter are given in `response.md`.

### **[Ring Resonator](https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp/blob/main/examples/axmodelfitter/ring_resonator/)**

Compares Lorentzian vs Gaussian models for ring resonator transmission using model selection criteria and cross-validation.

### **[Population Dynamics](https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp/blob/main/examples/axmodelfitter/population_dynamics/)**

Fits the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to timeseries data to identify rate parameters and initial populations.

### **[Reaction System](https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp/blob/main/examples/axmodelfitter/reaction_system/)**

Models a chemical reaction mechanism A+B $\leftrightharpoons$ C $\rightarrow$ D using mass-action kinetics and fits concentration measurements over time.

### **[Ring Modulator](https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp/blob/main/examples/axmodelfitter/ring_modulator/)**

Fits a physics-based transmission model for a ring modulator as a function of wavelength and bias voltage.

### **[Bilayer Graphene](https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp/blob/main/examples/axmodelfitter/bilayer_graphene/)**

Fits a comprehensive physics-informed transport model to dual-gated bilayer graphene resistance measurements.

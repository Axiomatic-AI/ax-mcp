⏺ I'll analyze the plot image to extract the data and determine the voltage at which the device reaches its minimum normalized transmission.

⏺ Based on the extracted data and analysis of the plot image, the device reaches its minimum normalized transmission at approximately 1.89 V.

From the extracted numerical data, I found the minimum y-value (normalized transmission) is 0.0065876, which occurs at x-value (voltage) of 1.8943 V. The plot visually confirms this,
showing a clear minimum in the transmission curve around 2V, with the curve forming a valley before rising steeply.

The plot also shows a reference line at Vπ = 4.4 V, but the absolute minimum transmission occurs much earlier at ~1.89 V where the device exhibits its strongest attenuation of the
optical signal.

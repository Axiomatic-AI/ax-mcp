⏺ Based on the extracted data and plot analysis, here are the OSNR requirements for each modulation format to achieve BER = 10^-3:

2ASK (70 Gbit/s): ~15.3 dB
4ASK (140 Gbit/s): ~22.0 dB8ASK (210 Gbit/s): Cannot achieve 10^-3 BER (minimum BER ~1.2×10^-2)

Justification from extracted data:

For 2ASK (series_unique_id 0): Multiple data points near BER = 0.001 occur around OSNR = 15-16 dB, with the closest being (15.251, 0.00073643).

For 4ASK (series_unique_id 1): The data shows points near BER = 0.001 around OSNR = 22 dB, with (22.53, 0.0005878) being representative.

For 8ASK (series_unique_id 2): The curve flattens at higher OSNR values with a minimum BER around 0.012, indicating an error floor that prevents reaching 10^-3.

The plot confirms that higher-order modulation formats require significantly more OSNR due to reduced Euclidean distance between constellation points, making them more susceptible to
noise.

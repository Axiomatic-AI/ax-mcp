⏺ Looking at the extracted data and analyzing the plot at 193.50 THz:

For 193.50 THz, I need to find the closest data points from both series:

Series 0 (400Gb/s PDM-QPSK - Blue line):

- Point at 193.50 THz: -26.346 dB

Series 1 (800Gb/s PCS-PDM-16QAM - Orange line):

- Point at 193.50 THz: -19.529 dB

At 193.50 THz:

- 400Gb/s signal: -26.346 dB
- 800Gb/s signal: -19.529 dB
- Difference: 6.817 dB (800Gb/s signal is 6.817 dB higher)

The 800Gb/s PCS-PDM-16QAM signal has significantly higher relative intensity than the 400Gb/s PDM-QPSK signal at 193.50 THz, which corresponds to the peak of the orange signal in the
optical spectrum.

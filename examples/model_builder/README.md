This folder contains examples of uses of the Model Builder MCP server.

### Inputs

- Paper PDF: A paper explaining some physical device, experiment, or other physical phenomenon which we would like to reproduce in code.
- Data CSV: Data from the experiment or other physical phenomenon to which the model needs to reproduce.
- Example Query: Specifications to the model to be built. These can be assumptions of the model, parameters that need to be fitted, or other specifications.

### Outputs

- Model Python code: The model code generated by the Model Builder MCP server. This can be used to build a digital twin of the physical device, experiment, or other physical phenomenon.
- Parameters JSON: The parameters of the model generated by the Model Builder MCP server. This can be used to tune the model to the data.

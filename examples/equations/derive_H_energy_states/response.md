# Hydrogen Spectrum Verification Summary

## Expert.SCIENTIFIC_TEAM Findings
- **Execution:** Module runs standalone or with pytest; all tests pass with diagnostic confirmation.  
- **Scientific Validity:** Hydrogen Hamiltonian derivation is rigorous, using correct kinetic operator, Coulomb potential, reduced mass, and quantum numbers.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Symbolic checks confirm formula correctness, l-independence, negativity of bound states, and balanced radial equation.  
- **Code Quality:** Functions ordered logically, no unused code, all lines justified by tests or execution.

**Conclusion:** Codebase robustly derives and verifies hydrogen energy levels, addressing prior feedback with no further changes needed.

## Expert.CODER_TEAM Changes
- **Fixed Errors:** All functions defined before use, exported via `__all__`; variable `correct` verified at import.  
- **Executability:** Added `__main__` harness for diagnostics, internal tests, and optional pytest invocation.  
- **Scientific Rigor:** Encoded radial Schrödinger equation with correct operators and symbolic derivation.  
- **Expanded Tests:** Added checks for symbolic equivalence, l-independence, potential form, negative energies, κ-substitution, and radial equation balance.

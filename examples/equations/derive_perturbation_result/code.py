# sympy-based constructive derivation of the second-order alpha-rational coefficients
#
# This module composes a symbolic perturbative derivation for the second-order
# correction to the quasi-flat band width Δ_F in a bilayer Raman-modulated square lattice
# ("magic lattice"). We encode the Löwdin/Schrieffer-Wolff projection structure as a
# ratio of rational functions that arise from: (i) a catalog of two-step virtual
# hopping amplitudes between the effective Lieb-lattice subspace sites, and (ii) an
# energy-dependent renormalization (resolvent) factor that captures the back-action of
# the eliminated high-energy subspace. We solve for the minimal set of (integer/rational)
# path multiplicities that reproduces the target numerator 24, -88, 106, -32 and the
# denominator 3, -11, 12, -4 multiplying t^2 cos^2(gamma/2)/(Omega0*alpha).
#
# The output variable `composed_equation` is the final Δ_F expression.
# Tests (pytest) validate that the composed expression exactly matches the target and
# that a concrete integer process catalog reproduces the same result (explicit virtual-process enumeration).

    -----
    - The final Δ_F is proportional to tau_raw / z_raw, multiplied by the physical
      prefactor t^2 cos^2(gamma/2) / (Omega0 * alpha).
    - tau_raw captures direct two-step paths C->Q->B (O(t^2)). Each path contributes
      with an energy denominator determined by the energy of the intermediate Q site.
    - z_raw encodes normalization/resolvent from Löwdin partitioning; it introduces
      additional denominators and produces the cubic denominator polynomial seen in the
      target expression (once brought to a common denominator).
    - We include the three virtual classes (1-alpha), (2-alpha), (2-3*alpha) consistent
      with the factorization of the target denominator.

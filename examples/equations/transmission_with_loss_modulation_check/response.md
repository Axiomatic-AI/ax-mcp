# Verification of Loss-Modulated Transmission \(T_a(t)\)

## Expert.SCIENTIFIC_TEAM — Findings
- **Objective:** Validate the correctness of the transmission with loss modulation \(T_a(t)\) as presented in the referenced paper.  
- **Validation:** Both the recurrence relation  
  \[
  T(t) = f(t) + g(t)\,T(t - \tau)
  \]  
  and its **Neumann-series expansion** were implemented and checked.  
- **Issue Resolution:** The key blocking `NameError` was fixed by declaring all required symbols at the top of the module.  
- **Testing:** Edge cases and finite truncations (\(N=0..3\)) were validated against the paper’s formulas. All tests passed.  
- **Code Quality:** No redundancy remains, the structure is clear, and the module is safe to import and execute.  

**Conclusion:** The solution is scientifically valid and technically robust. Verification is successful.

## Expert.CODER_TEAM — Implementation Notes
- **Fixes:**  
  - Declared symbolic parameters (`sigma`, `phi`, `tau`, `kappa`) at module scope to prevent `NameError`.  
  - Ensured `f` and `g` functions safely capture these symbols.  
- **Enhancements:**  
  - Added a `__main__` block for ad-hoc execution with confirmation output.  
  - Clarified pytest tests to check:  
    1. Truncated Neumann series matches the paper’s construction for \(N=0..3\).  
    2. Recurrence identity holds under symbolic substitution.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - Module imports cleanly with no errors.  
  - Tests confirm symbolic and numerical equivalence.  
  - The acceptance criteria are fully satisfied.

## Final Status
- **Transmission formula \(T_a(t)\) verified** against both recurrence and Neumann series.  
- **All tests passed** and code executes cleanly.  
- The implementation is **scientifically accurate, technically robust, and import-safe**.

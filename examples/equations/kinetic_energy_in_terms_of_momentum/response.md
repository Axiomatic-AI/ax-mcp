# Quantum Kinetic Energy Derivation – Final Review

## Expert.SCIENTIFIC_TEAM Findings
- **Execution:** Fixed `NameError` by defining `hbar` at module level; all symbols have correct physical assumptions.  
- **Scientific Validity:** Correct derivation of kinetic energy, \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), consistent with non-relativistic quantum mechanics.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - All tests (substitution, reduction, validation) pass.  
  - Self-contained, robust implementation.  
  - \(k\) and \(\hbar\) cancel, leaving only physical variables \(p, m\).  
- **Code Quality:** Clean, purposeful, no redundancy. Unicode alias `ħ` avoids future errors. Tests confirm correctness and robustness.

**Conclusion:** Scientifically accurate, robustly coded, and fully validated. No further changes required.

## Expert.CODER_TEAM Notes
- **Fixes:** Explicitly defined `hbar`; assumptions: `m>0`, `ħ>0`, with `p, k, E` real.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Self-contained module (no reliance on prior state).  
  - Unicode alias `ħ = hbar` for safety.  
- **Tests Verified:**  
  1. Final expression \(p^2/(2m)\).  
  2. Substitution \(k = p/ħ\) works correctly.  
  3. \(k\) and \(\hbar\) cancel in final form.  
  4. Equation form is correct.  
  5. Solving for \(k\) yields \(p/ħ\).

**Result:** Final exported equation is \(p^2/(2m)\), fully consistent and error-free.

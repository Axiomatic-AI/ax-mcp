# Dynamical Transmission Derivation — Final Summary

## Outcome
A **closed-form expression** for the microring’s **dynamical transmission** \(T(t)\) in terms of the circulating-field amplitude \(C(t)\) has been derived, implemented, and verified:

\[
T(t) \equiv \frac{B(t)}{A}
= \frac{a\,e^{-i\phi(t)}\,C(t-\tau)\;-\;\sigma(t)\,C(t)}
{\sigma(t)\,a\,e^{-i\phi(t)}\,C(t-\tau)\;-\;C(t)}.
\]

This result is produced and stored as `composed_equation`. All symbolic and numerical tests **pass**.

## Expert.SCIENTIFIC_TEAM — Assessment
- **Correctness:** The derivation follows standard, physically sound methods (solve, substitute, simplify), consistent with the microring model.
- **Completeness:** Final \(T(t)\) is in **closed form** and matches expectations for the system.
- **Rigor:** Both **symbolic** and **numerical** validations confirm the expression under relevant identities and parameter choices.
- **Quality:** Code executes cleanly; comments are concise; redundancies removed; symbol/name issues resolved.

**Verdict:** Requirements fully satisfied.

## Expert.CODER_TEAM — Implementation Notes
- **Bug fix:** Removed a stray undefined identifier line; `eq1` is now **defined exactly once** as a `sympy.Eq`.
- **Derivation flow (code):**
  1. Solve `eq2` for \(A\).
  2. Substitute into `eq1`, solve for \(B\).
  3. Form \(T = B/A\).
  4. Simplify using the **lossless coupler identity** \(\sigma^2 + \kappa^2 = 1\).
- **Safety check:** Added an internal, non-asserting comparison of derived \(T\) with the compact expected form under the lossless substitution.
- **Tests (pytest):**
  1. **Symbolic check** under the lossless identity.
  2. **Numerical check** for parameters satisfying \(\sigma^2 + \kappa^2 = 1\).
- **Housekeeping:** Code is now **self-consistent**, free of undefined names, with clarified comments.

## What This Gives You
- A **ready-to-use** symbolic formula for \(T(t)\) that captures full **time dynamics** via \(C(t)\), \(\phi(t)\), \(a(t)\), \(\sigma(t)\), and delay \(\tau\).
- A **tested** and **maintainable** code path for analysis, simulation, and further extensions (e.g., small-signal linearization, bandwidth studies).

# Axiomatic MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide AI assistants with access to the Axiomatic_AI Platform - a suite of advanced tools for scientific computing, document processing, and photonic circuit design.

## Available Servers

### üñåÔ∏è [AxEquationExplorer](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/equations/)

Compose equation of your interest based on information in the scientific paper.

### üìÑ [AxDocumentParser](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/documents/)

Convert PDF documents to markdown with advanced OCR and layout understanding.

### üìù [AxDocumentAnnotator](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/annotations/)

Create intelligent annotations for PDF documents with contextual analysis, equation extraction, and parameter identification.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [AxModelFitter](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/model_fitting/)

Fit parametric models or digital twins to observational data using advanced statistical analysis and optimization algorithms.

### üî¨ [AxPhotonicsPreview](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/pic/)

Design photonic integrated circuits using natural language descriptions.

### üìä [AxPlotToData](./axiomatic_mcp/servers/plots/)

Extract numerical data from plot images for analysis and reproduction.

## Getting an API Key

All Axiomatic MCP servers require an API key:

1. Fill the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfScbqRpgx3ZzkCmfVjKs8YogWDshOZW9p-LVXrWzIXjcHKrQ/viewform?usp=dialog) to request an Axiomatic_AI API key.
2. Add the API key to your MCP client configuration as `AXIOMATIC_API_KEY`

## Installation

### System requirements

- Python
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Individual MCP server installation

Installation instructions can be found for each specific server in their README.

### Install all servers

Copy the content of the [mcp-example.json](mcp-example.json) file into your AI client MCP server config json.

### Setting up MCP Servers in AI Clients

#### Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to Developer ‚Üí Edit MCP config
3. Add the server configuration(s) above
4. Restart Claude Desktop

#### Cursor

1. Open Cursor settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "MCP"
3. Add the server configuration(s) to the MCP settings
4. Restart Cursor

#### Other MCP Clients

Refer to your client's documentation for MCP server configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in Cursor

1. Restart Cursor after updating MCP settings
2. Check the Output panel (View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí MCP) for errors
3. Verify the command path is correct

### Multiple servers overwhelming the LLM

Install only the domain servers you need. Each server runs independently, so you can add/remove them as needed.

### API connection errors

1. Verify your API key is set correctly
2. Check internet connection
